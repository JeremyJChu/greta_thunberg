# Social Media Anaylsis of Greta Thunberg
Using a combination of R and Gephi, our team performed social media network, text, and sentiment analysis on how the public perceived Greta Thunberg around January 2020. Gossip about her Facebook account and her father, and then her subsequent Nobel Peace Prize nomination showed interesting fluctations in public sentiment. 

Data:
- Scraped from Twitter using Netlytic (~5000 tweets on #GretaThunberg)
- Scraped metadata of 100 Youtube videos (search "Greta Thunberg")

The report can be found [here]().
